# Hi

This is the flappy bird prototype where I demonstrated all of my
learnings in CS50 game track in the year 2020.

It isn't polished in terms of background and considering that I am
not an art guy, well, you could say I gave up midway in the art
part of the program.

But here it is! The flappy bird prototype that features all of my
knowledge of trigonometric manipulations, animations, programming
using Lua and Love2D.
